(ns haishin.plan
  "Fan one artifact out into one validated request description per target.

  Planning is pure and always available — no grant, no credentials, no network.
  That is deliberate: the useful thing to be able to do at any time, including
  in CI and in a governor's review step, is to see exactly what *would* be sent
  everywhere. Nothing here can send it.

  A plan separates entries from rejections rather than failing the whole batch
  on the first bad target. A 4-minute vertical video is a valid YouTube upload
  and an invalid X post, and the right answer is to publish it to YouTube and
  report why X was skipped — not to publish nothing."

                          read here — an ambient clock would make plans
                          non-reproducible and is exactly the kind of ambient
                          authority this library refuses.
    :tags?                append hashtags to composed text (default true)
    :attribution?         append the canonical source link (default true)
    :body-chars-override  raise the text limit for a target tier that allows
                          more than the documented default (X premium, ...)

  Throws only if the *artifact itself* is malformed — that is a producer bug,
  not a per-target outcome, and silently degrading it into six identical
  rejections would bury the cause."
