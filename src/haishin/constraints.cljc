  "Per-platform publishing limits, as data.

  These live in code rather than a resource file on purpose: the runtime
  priority in this workspace puts ClojureScript/nbb ahead of the JVM, and
  `slurp`-ing a resource is the one thing that does not port cleanly across
  those. A plain map ports everywhere.

  ## Provenance is part of the data

  Every limit carries `:constraint/checked-at`, `:constraint/source` and
  `:constraint/provenance`. Platform limits drift — a number with no date on it
  is a number nobody can audit. `:constraint/provenance` is honest about how the
  value got here:

    :in-repo-corroborated — an independently written client in this workspace
                            encodes the same number (strongest signal we have
                            offline)
    :vendor-doc           — read off the vendor's published API reference
    :unverified           — recorded from general knowledge and NOT yet checked
                            against the vendor doc

  **Anything still `:unverified` must be checked before that target is used for
  live posting.** `unverified-targets` exists so a caller can assert on it in
  its own test suite rather than discovering the drift in production. The
  library deliberately does not refuse to plan on unverified limits: planning is
  free and offline, and a wrong limit surfaces as a rejection you can read,
  which is more useful than a library that will not run."

  `:limit/*` keys are hard bounds — exceeding one is a rejection.
  `:prefer/*` keys are soft — missing one is a warning on the plan entry.
  `:media/requires-public-url` marks platforms whose API *pulls* the asset from
  a URL we host rather than accepting uploaded bytes. That is a real
  architectural constraint, not a detail: it means the artifact must already be
  publicly reachable before the post can be created at all."
